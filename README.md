# GriefPrevention - Minecraft anti-griefing plugin

Stop responding to grief and prevent it instead. Grief Prevention will solve
your grief problems without a roster of trained administrators, without 10
different anti-grief plugins, and without disabling any standard game features.
Because Grief Prevention teaches players for you, you won't have to publish a
training manual or tutorial for players, or add explanatory signs to your world.

Grief Prevention stops grief before it starts automatically without any effort
from administrators, and with very little (self service) effort from players.
Solve all your grief problems with a single anti grief download, no database,
and (for most servers) no configuration customization.

### Adding GriefPrevention as a gradle/maven/sbt/leiningen dependency

Apparently there's this neat thing called JitPack [![](https://jitpack.io/v/TechFortress/GriefPrevention.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#TechFortress/GriefPrevention) that makes a public maven repo for public Github repos on the fly.
According to it, this is all you need to do to add this to your maven project:
```xml
	<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
```

Replace `<version>` number with this number: [![](https://jitpack.io/v/TechFortress/GriefPrevention.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#TechFortress/GriefPrevention)
```xml
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.TechFortress</groupId>
	    <artifactId>GriefPrevention</artifactId>
	    <version>16.7.1</version>
	</dependency>
```

You can also add it to gradle/sbt/leiningen projects: https://jitpack.io/#TechFortress/GriefPrevention/
