# GriefPreventionPlus
While I was developing GriefPrevention-Cities, I found that GriefPrevention has lots of performance issues (expecially with MySQL database) and some limitation. Currently, most of MC servers are version 1.7.10, so I found very bad to not apply new fixes to Grief Prevention for MC1.7.10. This became GriefPreventionPlus!

Feedback are needed! If you found an issue, please report it!
Please use the "issues" page on Github!

###Installation
- If you've installed GriefPrevention, remove GriefPrevention jar from plugins folder
- Put GriefPreventionPlus jar into plugins folder

If an existing GriefPrevention database is found, a copy will migrate to GriefPreventionPlus.
Your GriefPrevention database won't be removed: you can rollback to GriefPrevention if you need!

###Major features
- GriefPreventionPlus's MC1.7.10 version contains last fixes from GriefPrevention's MC1.8 version!
- MySQL database is a requirement. Removed file based storage.
- Drastically improved database performances and reduced size: bigger servers will notice it!
- Overall speed improvements
- API improvements: all claims and subdivisions have an unique id
- Less waste of resources (RAM)
- Javadoc for extension developers! (planned)

####Notice
- GriefPrevention's extensions don't work with GriefPreventionPlus without some little change on the code. If needed, I will fork most important GriefPrevention's extension to make it work with GriefPreventionPlus! You can ask for it!
- GriefPrevention 10.6.2 commit is not applied. Untrust in top level claims won't untrust in subdivisions. You can remove a player from all your claims if you're not on a claim.
