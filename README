This repo contains a HISTORICAL version of GriefPrevention, the up to the last version the original author (that's me) produced.  After about 5 years working on the project, I finally decided to move on to independent game development, and so I left the project in the hands of the best expert on the project I could find.

If you're looking to research or contribute to the current version of GriefPrevention, look elsewhere on GitHub.  :)  I don't plan to take down this repo because I want everyone to have access to my source code, and I can't guarantee that it will remain open to the public unless I do it myself.

If you'd like to follow me in my future adventures in independent game development, see facebook.com/bigscarygames.  At the time of this writing, I'm starving for moral support and project feedback.
